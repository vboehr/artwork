If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections, you'll really be helping the network a lot. Port 9184 on your firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.

The software is still alpha and experimental. There's no guarantee the system's state won't have to be restarted at some point if it becomes necessary, although I've done everything I can to build in extensibility and versioning.

You can get globaldce coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on CPU mining to run a node and generate blocks.  We made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate coins in just a few hours. It'll get a lot harder when competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty. Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be spent.
