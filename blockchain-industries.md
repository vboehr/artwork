the puck chain is one of the most  promising new technologies for the  future so what is it it's a distributed  ledger technology that underlies crypto  currencies like Bitcoin and provides a  way to record and transfer data that is  transparent safe auditable and resistant  to outages the blockchain has the  ability to make the organizations that  use it transparent democratic  decentralized efficient and secure the  whole chain is likely to disrupt many  industries in the coming five to ten  years these are some of the industries  it's already disrupting number one  banking and payments some people say  that the blockchain will do two banking  with the Internet to media blockchain  technology can be used to give access to  financial services to billions of people  around the world including those in  third world countries who don't have  access to traditional banking  technologies like Bitcoin allow anyone  to send money across borders almost  instantly and with very low fees Abra is  a startup that is working on Bitcoin  based remittance services and many banks  like Barclays are also working on  adopting blockchain technology to make  their business operations faster more  efficient and secure banks are also  increasingly investing in blockchain  projects and startups IBM predicts that  about 15% of banks will be using the  blockchain by the end of 2017 number 2  cybersecurity  although the blockchain ledger is public  the data is verified and encrypted using  advanced cryptography this way the data  is less prone to being hacked or changed  without authorization the blockchain  eliminates the need for middlemen making  it more efficient than many legacy  systems and cyber security number 3  supply chain management with blockchain  technology transactions can be  documented in a permanent decentralized  record and monitored securely and  transparently  this can greatly reduce time delays and  human mistakes it can also be used to  monitor costs labor and even waste and  emissions at every point in the supply  chain this has serious implications for  understanding and controlling the real  environmental impact of products the  blockchain can also be used to verify  the authenticity or fair trade status of  products by tracking them from their  origin some blockchain startups working  in this sector are Providence fluent SKU  chain and block verify number for  forecasting blockchain is set to change  the entire approach to research  consulting analysis and forecasting  online platforms like augur are looking  to create global decentralized  prediction markets these technologies  can be used to place and monitor bets on  anything from sports to stocks to  elections in a decentralized way number  5 networking and Internet of Things  Samsung and IBM are using blockchain  technology for a new concept called  adept which will create a decentralized  network of IOT devices operating like a  public ledger for a large number of  devices it would eliminate the need for  a central location to handle  communications between them the devices  would be able to communicate to each  other directly to update software manage  bugs and monitor energy usage number-6  insurance the global insurance market is  based on trust management blockchain is  a new way of managing trust and can be  used to verify many types of data in  insurance contracts like the insured  persons identity so-called Oracles can  be used to integrate real world data  with blockchain smart contracts this  technology is very useful for any types  of insurance that relies on real world  data for example crop insurance  eternities one blockchain project that  is building tools that are useful in the  insurance industry number seven  private transport and ride-sharing the  blockchain can be used to create  decentralized versions of peer-to-peer  ride-sharing apps allowing both car  owners and users to arrange terms and  conditions in a secure way with  third party providers startups working  in this area include Arcade City and  less the use of built-in wallets can  allow for car owners to automatically  pay for parking highway tolls and  electricity top-ups to the vehicle  UBS ZF and energy are some of the  startups developing blockchain based  wallets number eight cloud storage data  on a centralized server is inherently  vulnerable to hacking data loss or human  error using blockchain technology allows  cloud storage to be more secure and  robust against attacks storage is one  example of a cloud storage network using  blockchain technology number nine  charity con complaints in charity space  include inefficiency and corruption  which prevent money from reaching those  who are meant to have it using  blockchain technology to track donations  can let you be sure that your money is  going to end up in the right hands  Bitcoin based charities like bit give  Foundation use blockchain secure and  transparent distributed ledger to let  donors see that the intended party is  receive the funds number 10 voting  probably one of the most important areas  of society that blockchain will disrupt  is voting the 2016 US election is not  the first time certain parties were  accused of rigging election results  block chain technology can be used for  voter registration and identity  verification and electronic vote  counting to ensure that only legitimate  votes are counted and no votes are  changed or removed creating an immutable  publicly viewable ledger of recorded  votes would be a massive step forward in  making elections more fair and  democratic democracy earth and follow my  vote are two startups aiming to disrupt  democracy itself through creating  blockchain based online voting systems  for governments number 11 government  government systems are often slow and  opaque and prone to corruption  implementing blockchain based systems  can significantly reduce bureaucracy and  increase security efficiency and  transparency of government operate  Dubai for example is aiming to put its  government documents on the blockchain  by 2020 number 12 public benefits the  public benefit system is another sector  that suffers from slowness and  bureaucracy doctrine technology can help  assess verify and distribute welfare or  unemployment benefits in a much more  streamlined and secure way gov coin is a  uk-based company that is helping the  government to distribute public benefits  using blockchain technology the  blockchain is also a good contender for  implementing a basic income  circle's is a project working on  developing a blockchain based technology  for implementing a universal basic  income number 13 Healthcare another  industry that relies on so many legacy  systems and is right for disruption is  health care one of the challenges  hospitals face is the lack of a secure  platform to store and share data there  are also often victims of hacking  because of outdated infrastructure  blockchain technology can allow  hospitals to safely store data like  medical records and share with the  authorized professionals or patients  this will improve data security and can  even help improve accuracy and speed of  diagnosis gem and tirion are two  startups that are working on disrupting  the current healthcare data space number  14 energy management energy management  has been a highly centralized industry  for a long time energy producers and  users cannot buy it directly from each  other and have to go through the public  grid or trusted private intermediary  transactive grid is a start-up using the  ethereum blockchain that allows  customers to buy and sell energy  directly from each other in a  peer-to-peer way number 15  online music several blockchain startups  are coming up with ways for musicians to  get paid directly from their fans  without giving up large percentages of  sales to platforms or record companies  spark contracts can also be used to  automatically solve licensing issues and  better catalog songs with the respective  creators my Celia in Ojo music our two  startups creating blockchain based  solutions in the music  number 16 retail when you shop you trust  the retail system of the store or the  marketplace decentralized blockchain  based retail utilities work differently  they connect buyers and sellers without  a middleman and associated fees  sorry Amazon in these cases trust comes  from smart contract systems the security  of exchanges and built-in reputation  management systems to startups  disrupting the retail space are open  Bazaar and obi-wan number 17  real estate some of the issues in buying  and selling real estate our bureaucracy  lack of transparency fraud and mistakes  and public records using blockchain  technology can speed up transactions by  reducing the need for paper-based  record-keeping it can also help with  tracking verifying ownership ensuring  accuracy of documents and transferring  property deeds ubiquity is a blockchain  secured platform for real estate  record-keeping that is an alternative  for legacy paper-based systems number 18  crowdfunding crowdfunding has become a  popular method of fundraising for new  startups and projects in recent years  crowdfunding platforms exist to create  trust between project creators and  supporters but they also charge high  fees without chain based crowdfunding  trust is created through smart contracts  and online reputation systems which  removes the need for a middleman new  projects can raise funds by releasing  their own tokens that represent value  and can later be exchanged for products  services or cash many blockchain  projects have now raised millions of  dollars through such token sales  although it's still early days and the  regulatory future of blockchain based  crowdfunding is uncertain it's an area  that holds a lot of promise  number 19 your industry if your industry  deals with data or transactions of any  kind it's likely a field that can be  disrupted by blockchain technology the  space is wide open and the opportunities  are many did we miss anything  what are some other industries the  blockchain is disrupting leave your  comments below
