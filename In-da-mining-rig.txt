Go, go, go, go, go, go
Go, shorty
It's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
We gon' sip tea like it's your birthday
And you know we don't really care it's not your birthday
(Verse 1)
I was broke, unemployed, starting to slouch,
Sleeping on my momma's couch, feeling like a grouch,
But then I heard a call, a chance to change it all,
A crypto fortune like my ex-girl, standing tall.

Got the top-notch GPUs, power supply on my side,
Microprocessor, motherboard, storage let go worldwide,
RAM in the slots, drives in the larger bay,
Two fans cooling, like Chargers on game day.

Price spiked to point thirty, I missed out, what a fear,
Assembling a rig like an engineer, I'm here,
Friends and fam laughing, making fun of me,
But I'll prove 'em wrong 'cause I'm 'bout to be a G.

(Chorus)
A globaldce Millionaire,
Spending money without a care,
Mining coin in my underwear,
I'm gonna be a globaldce Millionaire.

(Verse 2)
Choosing software, reading up on the notes,
Picking miners like a Penn State coach,
Digital wallet for holding all my wealth,
Multiple accounts, securing every stealth.

Feeling like Tom Brady, inflation on my mind,
But this crypto game, it's a different kind,
Flipping scripts, laptop encrypted, I shifted,
From rotten life to Dubai's finest, uplifted.

Even on vacation, I'm supplying the crypto,
Gentrifying the block, watch my balance grow,
Friends ask what's the best part of this treasury,
I say, "Remember when you doubted my legendary?"

(Chorus)
A globaldce Millionaire,
Spending money without a care,
Flash drives in her underwear,
Now that I'm a globaldce Millionaire.

(Verse 3)
Cash flow never-ending, upscale and rowdy,
Spending like a 7, yo, scaling high like Saudi,
Call it mad bankin', all night, all weekend,
My rig's Al Franken, grabbin' while you're sleepin'.

Try to outspend me, see my mission in action,
More globaldce coins drop than a clumsy obstetrician,
No splits, no forks, don't care what's best or not,
Opposing like Chinese cuisine, no plan to stop.

From geek to chic, basic to ASIC, the transition,
From squatting in basements to yachts on a mission,
No longer depressed,I'm peer-to-peer legend, I'm shinin',

(Chorus)
A globaldce Millionaire,
Spending money without a care,
Flash drives in her underwear,
Now that I'm a globaldce Millionaire.


Don't try to act like you don't know where we be neither
We are mining all the time, cryptobro, so pop, pop off
globaldce
