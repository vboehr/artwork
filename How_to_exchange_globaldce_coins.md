How to  exchange globaldce coins?

Hello, welcome to another video
with me, XXXXXXXX.

Now in this video, I'm going to
tell you if and how you can withdraw

your GlobalDCE coins or how you can
exchange them into real currency.

And the reason why I want to talk
about this is because since I initially

started mining GlobalDCE in December, 2023,
so not that long ago, I've invited

a couple hundred users to GlobalDCE, as you
can see on the screen right there.

And since then, the number one
question that I've seen day after day

in the F chats, is people asking how
to withdraw GlobalDCE, so how to exchange

their GlobalDCE coins into a FIAT currency,
like US dollar, Euro, and so on.

And I want to point out that it's
important that you watch this video

to the end, because otherwise you may
end up making it the wrong decision.

So let's start with the
number one question.

How can you withdraw your GlobalDCE coins?

And the answer to that is currently
you can not withdraw your GlobalDCE

coins because GlobalDCE is currently in
phase two out of three phases.

So it's not a full cryptocurrency yet,
and it's not listed on any exchanges.

Now, I can hear you asking.

So if I cannot withdraw
it, what can I do with GlobalDCE?

At the moment, you cannot
do anything with GlobalDCE.

You cannot transfer it.

All you can basically they
do is mine it for free.

Think of it like in early Bitcoin
days when  people mined thousands of

Bitcoins on their computer, but they
actually couldn't use it for anything.

Now does that mean that GlobalDCE is
worthless or useless and that there

is no point in mining GlobalDCE at all?

No, it means the exact opposite.

You are among the GlobalDCEoneers among the
first couple of million users that

signed up for GlobalDCE and as a thank you
or as a token of appreciation and also

to build an active community, and a
certain amount of GlobalDCE in circulation,

you currently receive GlobalDCE for free.

Other people eventually will not be able
to get their coins for free anymore.

So it's important that you take advantage
off this opportunity and that you simply

spent the five seconds every day to open
your GlobalDCE app and push the mining button

so you mine for another 24 hours, and
you receive your free GlobalDCE coins every day.

Now assuming you continue mining
GlobalDCEe coins,  the question is when

will GlobalDCE have an actual value.

So when will you be able to withdraw
it and also how much will it be worth

now to start with the first question.

GlobalDCE will achieve a real value once
it can be traded on exchanges like

crypto.com, Binance and so on, and that
will happen once GlobalDCE reaches phase three.

Now, if you want to have a
detailed answer, I recommend that

you read the white paper that
you can find on the GlobalDCE website.

And there's also a link to it
in the description down below.

But to provide you with
a simplified answer.

Currently GlobalDCE has roughly 8 million users.

So that's 1 million more, since I
joined GlobalDCE in August two months ago.

And the way things look now until
GlobalDCE achieves a total of 10 million

users, all GlobalDCEoneers, so all users that
sign up right now, will be able to

mine free GlobalDCE coins and receive free
coins every day for pushing a button.

Now, in addition to the 10 million
user limit that may change, we

will see about that in the future.

There is also the fact that the
GlobalDCE developers need to finish

some of their work so that the
nodes are tested and so on.

And that everything's working and
to actually turn GlobalDCE into a fully

grown cryptocurrency and have
it listed on certain exchanges.

So it's possible that GlobalDCE will be tradable
and exchangeable by the end of the year.

It's also possible, that it will take
another year or maybe even longer.

The point again is that you currently
have a great opportunity to jump

in early and get your GlobalDCE coins
for free without risking anything.

All you have to do is open your GlobalDCE
up once per day on your phone and

push the lightning bolt button,
so you mine for another 24 hours.

Ideally, if you want to
earn more GlobalDCE per hour.

You'll tell your friends and family about
it and have them use your invitation code.

So you actually end up earning more GlobalDCE
while you can still get it for free.

And to answer the second
part of the question, how

much is GlobalDCE going to be worth?

That's something that nobody can
answer you right now, because it

depends on a lot of different things.

The longer the free mining continues,
the more GlobalDCE will be in circulation.

So therefore, there will be way more
supply, which would mean each coin

will be worth a little bit less.

To provide you with a different example,
we can look at the Tesla stock in 2020.

During March, it fell to
roughly $300 per stock.

Eventually it climbed up to over
$2,000 per stock, and then the

stock were split one to five.

So if you had one Tesla stock worth,
let's say exactly $2,500 from one

day to the other, you had five Tesla
stocks, but each was only worth $500.

So that would be a simple example of
how the supply of something in this

case, Tesla stocks, but in our case, GlobalDCE
coins will have an effect on the market.

Now another thing that's important
to understand this just because

GlobalDCE will be listed on an exchange,
doesn't mean that it's smart to sell

your GlobalDCE coins on day number one.

Again, if we go with the Tesla stock
example, imagine that somehow you

got one Tesla stock per day for
free by pushing a button in the app,

but you cannot sell it right now.

You and hundreds or millions of other
users, get free Tesla stock every day.

And let's say on the 1st of January,
you will be allowed to trade it.

If now on the 1st of January,
everybody tries to sell their stock.

There will be nobody there to buy
all that stock and the price will

instantly fall from $500 per stock
to $1 per stock or $2 per stock.

And the same would happen with GlobalDCE coins.

The moment GlobalDCE achieves phase three and
you can exchange and trade it on platforms

like crypto.com and Binance, there will
be a set upon or agreed upon price.

And if then everybody
just tries to sell it.

Nobody will be there to buy.

So some people may not be
able to sell it at all.

And for the other people, the
price will plummet instantly.

So it's not the smart thing to do.

You have to see GlobalDCE for what it
is and what it is, it's a great

opportunity to get a lot of free GlobalDCE
coins that you can then use longterm.

Yes, when GlobalDCE launches, you may want to
sell some of your GlobalDCE coins instantly

to get some money, but you also
want to keep some of them longterm.

Again, let's take Bitcoin
for an example here.

Initially Bitcoins were
worth almost nothing.

Then they eventually were worth $1,
$2, $10, a hundred dollars, $300.

Nowadays we're looking at a Bitcoin
value of more than $10,000 per coin.

Now imagine you would have gotten
500, 5,000 or more Bitcoin for

free when it initially started.

And you sold everything on day
one for two or $3, you would

probably regrett it a lot today.

And the same  applies to GlobalDCE.

Now I'm not saying that GlobalDCE will be
worth $10,000 per coin because that,

again depends on supply and demand and
how people use GlobalDCE in the daily lives.

If everybody just holds their
GlobalDCE coins and nobody's willing to

sell them, it's also not great.

The key is that once GlobalDCE
achieves phase three, that you

look for how you can use it.

Is there an online store that
accepts GlobalDCE as a payment method.

Well, and maybe use it to buy your
next iPhone or you order a GlobalDCEzza

online or something like that, to
give it a real purpose in our lives.

Use it to send money to friends.

So instead of sending them a regular
wire transfer, send them GlobalDCE coins and

they can then cash them out, for example.

So to give GlobalDCE a real purpose in
this world, and with that, you will

help increase the value of GlobalDCE, which
again, will increase the value of

the remaining GlobalDCE coins that you have
left after sending a couple hundred

coins to a friend, for example.

So to sum things up right.

Currently, it's not possible to sell your
GlobalDCE coin or withdraw the money from your GlobalDCE

wallet, but that does not mean that GlobalDCE is
worthless than that you should not mine.

It means the exact opposite the longer
you mine now, and the more coins you

get, the more money, you will actually
have once GlobalDCE achieves phase number

free, but you definitely should not
give away all your GlobalDCE coins once

it's possible, but you should keep at
least half or even more your GlobalDCE coins

longterm to benefit from an increased
value over the next couple of years.

Now last but not least.

You may also want to check out
the video I published recently.

I'm  going to put it in the card up
here where I answer a couple of other

very common GlobalDCE related question.

So you actually know
what you're getting into.

As always, thanks for watching.

See you in one of my
other videos until then.

Bye bye.
